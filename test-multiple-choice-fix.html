<strong>Your API Response:</strong>
Q.1 Which one of the following statements about art best captures the argu-
ments made in the passage?
1. In the age of online subscription services, it is time to change our understanding of
classic works of art being primarily immutable and easily available to the public.
2. Accepting retroactive changes to works of art is dangerous because it will encourage
creators to not put enough effort into the original attempt, given that they can
always edit or update their work later.
3. Works of art belong to the cultural commons and hence must remain available in
perpetuity, irrespective of who pays for access to them.
4. As art is increasingly created, stored, and distributed digitally, access to it is coun-
terintuitively likely to be made more difficult by the rapid churn in technology and
the whims of host platforms.

<strong>Key Changes Made:</strong>
1. Fixed ordered list detection logic
2. Improved line matching between HTML and original markdown
3. Added debugging for multiple choice questions
4. Enhanced list type detection (ol vs ul)

<strong>Debugging Added:</strong>
- [ButtonPanel] Found ordered list items: ["1.", "2.", "3.", "4."]
- [ButtonPanel] Ordered list count: 4
- [ButtonPanel] Detected question format - likely multiple choice
- [ButtonPanel] Starting list type: ol for line: 1. In the age...
- [ButtonPanel] Final ordered lists found: 1
- [ButtonPanel] First ordered list: &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

<strong>To Test the Fix:</strong>
1. Upload your PDF with the multiple choice question
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for the debugging messages listed above
4. Verify that the options show as 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of 1, 1, 1, 1
5. Check that the list is wrapped in &lt;ol&gt; tags (ordered list)
